### ahhhh what does all this mean

_style.scss is the main framework of the stylesheets. This is to ensure there is consistency across the stylesheets and any bug fixes, suggestion implementations etc. will apply across all of them. This also makes it easier to do future variations because all you essentially need to do is choose colours.

Customisations between the different stylesheets are then controlled by [Sass variables](http://sass-lang.com/). Each respective stylesheet's variables are located in their respective .scss file. Using an appropriate application, you can then set it so that any changes in _style.scss or to any of the stylesheet variables, will compile into resultant .css stylesheets.

If you've never used Sass before, try [Koala](http://koala-app.com/) which is an incredibly simple GUI application for it. You just need to add your working directory, set the scss files to auto compile with a compressed output, and then leave it running in the background. Sass is quite extensive but because i r css newb, I'm just using variables for now which are pretty self-explanatory.

### i don't care about this confusing nerd talk, i just want you to add or fix something

Cool, just post in the thread then and I'll see it, or if you're feeling adventuruous, [create an issue for it](https://github.com/aldykins/delicious/issues) because I'll be making one for it anyway.

If you're just reading this because you like the stylesheet, thanks for using it!
